Lumi Cue is an Alexa skill that combines visual and auditory cues for timers. Ask Alexa to tell Lumi Cue to set a timer. While it runs, your Lifx lights will create a soothing ambiance. At the end of your timer, the lights will revert back to your original settings.

## Using Lumi Cue for the first time
Before using Lumi Cue for the first time, you will need to set up your personal Lifx token.

### Creating a Lifx Token
If you have a Lifx account already set up, follow [this link](https://cloud.lifx.com/settings) to the Lifx Cloud to generate a unique user token. Lumi Cue will use this token in order to toggle your personal Lifx lights.

Once you have created your personal Lifx token, open the Alexa app on your phone, and do the following:
1. Navigate to the icon on the bottom right of the screen labeled "More."
2. Select "Lists and Notes."
3. Create a new list named **EXACTLY** "LifxToken"
4. Paste your personal Lifx token as the only item in the list.

| ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: Lumi Cue will use this list each time you call the skill in order to access your personal token. **Do not delete this list after your first use.** |
| --- |

### Granting permissions
To open Lumi Cue for the first time, tell Alexa "Open Lumi Cue."
She will respond by saying that Lumi Cue needs permission to access your timers and lists. To grant Lumi Cue permissions, open your Alexa app on your phone and click the card to grant permissions to Lumi Cue.

### Setting your first timer
Once you have put your Lifx token in the correct list and granted Lumi Cue permissions, you're ready to create your first timer! After opening Lumi Cue, you can say "Set timer," and Alexa will prompt you for the name and length of the timer.
>> "Set timer."

>> "Set oven timer for thirty minutes."

After your first time opening Lumi Cue, you can call comands at the same time that you invoke the skill. For example, you may say,
>>"Hey Alexa, tell Lumi Cue to set a laundry timer for twenty minutes."

At any point, you can exit Lumi Cue by saying an exit command.

>> "Exit."

>> "Never mind."

## Interacting with Lumi Cue

## Known issues
While we strived to create the best skill possible in the time given, there are some issues that we will update as we are able. These include:
- Handling Lifx white lights
- Saving tokens long-term
