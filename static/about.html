        <h1 id="title">About Lumi Cue</h1>
        <p>Lumi Cue is a transformation from frustration to creativity. The initial inspiration came when fighting to get a 
            smart speaker to work in a new way. After brainstorming with other students at Holberton, the Lumi Cue team began to
             explore ways to use an Alexa skill to brighten up people’s lives. We set out to use our portfolio project to help those
              with executive dysfunction. As we explored timers, we wanted to develop a visual element that would bring a sense of 
              calm.</p>

        <p>In the end, we developed a skill that we’re excited to use in our own homes. We hope that you will be, too.</p>

                <h2>Carlos Esquivel</h2>
                <p>Carlos Esquivel is originally from Tulsa. After taking a gap year and working in sales, he decided to make a switch into 
                    the technology industry to obtain skills in software engineering. As the pandemic hit, Holberton school provided an 
                    opportunity to learn and grow in a remote working environment.</p>
                <p>As a software engineering student, Carlos enjoys the creative aspects of problem solving such as how collaboration can 
                    foster the transfer of knowledge.</p>
